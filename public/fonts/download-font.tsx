// This is just a helper file to remind you to download the font
// You need to download the MS Sans Serif font and place it in the public/fonts directory

// Download MS Sans Serif from:
// https://github.com/csswizardry/fonts/raw/master/microsoft/MS-Sans-Serif-8pt.woff2

// Then place it in the public/fonts directory as ms-sans-serif.woff2
// Make sure the filename matches exactly what's referenced in layout.tsx and globals.css
